 ##LEADER DESCS##
 ################
 POLITICS_MOHAMMED_ZAHIR_SHAH_DESC:0 "If Afghanistan is the Graveyard of Empires, then Mohammed Zahir Shah is its undertaker. From 1933, when he became King of Afghanistan, up to the present, the king has made it his mission to ensure that no foreign power takes even a step on his land. British, Japanese, Russian, German - it mattered little, even when he collaborated with them; they were all the same. All would be trapped in the mountains if they tried to strike him down, and all would be killed by the heroic people of his kingdom.\n\nHe was never an enemy of democracy; he supported liberalization and civil liberties. But the Axis doesn't offer the rest of Pashtunistan in exchange for military support everyday. It was a deal made in heaven, or so the king thought. And so, the Afghan National Army marched into British territory - and were met with a barrage of artillery fire and machine guns. They did get some territory, alright; in exchange, the armies of the British and their Nehruist collaborators took a hundred thousand souls. They had unified the Pashtun nation now, but for what cost?\n\nNow, managing a multitude of ethnic groups and peoples, during an intense and violent period in world history, those liberal reforms the King keeps talking about will be needed. With Japan and Germany fighting for influence, Iran moving closer to its death, and Delhi slowly building up for its revenge, the King will need a lot more than the mountains to stay on top. Otherwise, he shall find his gravestone along with all the other false rulers thinking they could rule innocently in an age like this."
