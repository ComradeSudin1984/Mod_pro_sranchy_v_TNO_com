 #Starting Ideas
 ILG_Wild_Frontier:0 "The Wild Frontier"
 ILG_Wild_Frontier_desc:0 "As an unofficial military governorate in de jure French territory, we do not receive much attention from Rome. This has essentially rendered us useless and impotent, and our only hope for survival is aid from our Italian brethren."

 ILG_Unofficial_Italian_Settlement:0 "Unofficial Italian Settlement"
 ILG_Unofficial_Italian_Settlement_desc:0 "Due to the fact that the territory is ripe for settlement, many poor Italians have immigrated in the hopes of acquiring land. Needless to say, mass immigration of Italians will only compound our miseries due to our weak hold over the area."

 ILG_Saharan_Bandits_Bad:0 "Rampant Banditry"
 ILG_Saharan_Bandits_Bad_desc:0 "A limited military presence and a lack of manpower means that bandits constantly raid our convoys and loot settlements. However, it is at a boiling point, as destitute natives flock to their ranks in the hope of emerging out of poverty, thus making Italian control even more difficult to maintain."

 ILG_Saharan_Bandits_Crisis:0 "Rampant Banditry"

 ILG.3.t:0 "Iberia Attacks!"
 ILG.3.d:0 "The inevitable has finally come to pass: After a short period of complete diplomatic silence from Iberian Algeria, armed militias have been spotted crossing the border in Kabylie, Touggourt, Adrar, and several other regions along the Italian frontier. Although war has not been officially declared by either of our countries, one thing is clear: Iberia has begun a military offensive directly into Italian Algeria.\n\n Upon hearing of the situation, the initial response from mainland Italy has been disappointingly unalarmed — vague promises for extra shipments of equipment and manpower, and sometimes, nothing more than words of support. The ability for our inevitable calls for reinforcement to successfully maneuvere the tense political situation in Rome is not certain, and if the mainland decides that the cost of holding Algeria to be simply too great, it is possible that we may be left with very little, if any, additional support from Italy for the remainder of the war. Adding onto our troubles, this conflict shall certainly exacerbate our already significant issues with banditry; as more and more of our security forces are redirected to the Iberian front, and increasing amounts of our already scant supplies is lost to the scorching Algerian desert, roving hordes of native bandits may find easy opportunities for convoy raiding, further hurting our supply.\n\nIn any case, all of our currently deployed military forces are quickly beginning to mobilize, and any additional militias we can muster are being activated. As our few operational aircraft scramble off their runways, and ragtag groups of native platoons begin their trek through the Algerian desert, many question if we are capable of actually staging an offensive into the Iberian military government to expel their forces from Algeria entirely, and failing that, if we are capable of even repelling the incoming Iberian assault. Regardless, the battle for Algeria has begun. "

 ILG.7.t:0 "Iberian Algeria Surrenders!"
 ILG.7.d:0 "Through the blood, sweat, and tears of native and Italian forces alike, we have triumphed over Iberia!\n\nWith Italian-Algerian forces marching through Oran, as well as the loss of control of the vast majority of the Algerian desert, Iberia has accepted defeat. It has begrudgingly arranged for all of Iberian Algeria's territorial possessions to be formally turned over to our military governorate, and seeing no other option, the Iberian-Algerian Governor Jorge Jardim has been forced to return to Iberia.\n\nHowever, we are forced to make a difficult decision: In order for any any semblance of stablity to return to the war-torn country, we must end the current military government and replace it with a more permanent political system, one which is hopefully capable of maintaining stabilty and lasting peace.\n\nWe could respect our previously made promises of autononmy to the Algerian people, and establish an Algerian Republic, headed by FLN chairmen Ferhat Abbat. This state, although close to Rome, would be a democratic nation, independent from direct Italian meddling. Although we would cede the ability to directly dominate Algeria, the newly-formed country would continue to be squarely in our sphere of influence, allowing us to retain significant influence on the region.\n\n Alternatively, we could walk back on our promise, and establish an Algerian puppet state under the direct supervision of the native politican Said Boualam. Such a state would remain effectively part of our empire, and would serve as a useful bargaining chip with the French State, as well as provide an extended direct front with the Iberian Union in case of further aggression. However, Boulam is widely disliked by the populace for his anti-independence stances, and such a move could incite the already-high tensions between the current government and the native people to a boil.\n\nWith the future of Algeria in our hands, what decision do we make?"
 ILG.7.a:0 "Algeria shall remain under our direct control."
 ILG.7.b:0 "We must honor our promise to the Algerian people."

 ILG.8.t:0 "Birth of the Algerian Mandate"
 ILG.8.d:0 ""Well then," Pirani said, hope in his voice, "have we reached a mutual agreement?" The conference had been ongoing for several hours now, marked by periods of concessions, affirmations, and a sense of overarching fatigue. The Iberian diplomat looked down for a moment, quickly resetting his gaze squarely on Pirani and the rest of the Italian delegation. \n\n"I suppose so." Several reserved, but still audible sighs could be heard throughout the spacious room. "We'd like to discuss some of the specifics, of course, but yes, we find these conditions palatable." \n\n Word had quickly reached the Duce of the successful conference; as artfully explained to him a few days prior, the proposed plan would have Algeria been ruled under a dual-mandate. Instead of maintaining the vague borders between the various occupation zones, Iberian and Italian soldiers alike would keep the peace, with a functioning democractic state being built on the sands of Algeria, one which represents both native and settled inhabitants in the running of the country. A favorable outcome, of course, the Duce remarked. While there was a plausible chance of Italy winning the war that seemed so inevitable only a short time ago, neither the region nor the expected public outcry against a war made fighting such a war worth it, whether it be in the long or short term.\n\nIn any case, Algeria has been spared the horror of war, but a tulmotulous future awaits it still. If either Iberia or Italy decides to withdraw from the territory, the Duce knew, the remaining country would be forced to choose to either spend significant amounts of resources maintaining it, or to follow suit and abandon Algeria entirely. Still, all of Italy can enjoy the triumph of peace for today."
 ILG.8.a:0 "The best possible option."

 #Leader Description
 POLITICS_GIUSEPPE_CASTELLANO_DESC:0 "General Giuseppe Castellano is perhaps one of the most common topics of gossip among the upper circles of the Regio Esercito. A veteran of two world wars, he served with distinction in the Balkans during the last World War, before rising up the ranks of the Italian high command. Castellano's ambition reached high, but destiny had other plans - a few years after the end of the war, the new Duce, Galeazzo Ciano, entrusted Castellano with watching over the lawless Algerian frontier.\n\nCastellano has been the head of the Algerian Military Territory for a few years now, but his leadership was not very much effective in amending the situation in the region. Italian settlers, mostly from Sicily and often tied to old mafia families, were enticed by Algeria, as the region was perceived to be far from the watching eye of the authorities in Rome. Settlers' enclaves now dot the Algerian landscape, and many rumors circulate about the true extent of Castellano's relationships with the mafia; and the instability is only further fueled by Rome's decision to support native Algerian militias, such as the Front de Libération Nationale, in their armed struggle against encroaching Iberian authorities and their Pied Noirs allies.\n\nThe Governor General, stranded in Algeria and given very little resources to actually do his job, was largely forced to sit and watched as the situation further slipped away from his grasp. However, with renewed tensions arising in the Triumvirate, soon Algeria and Castellano might find themselves in the spotlight once more. Once that happens, perhaps Castellano will have his chance to redeem himself in the eyes of Italy - from a general ruling over a backwater corner of the Empire through shady deals and backroom negotiations, to a hero of the nation who saved its frontiers from the many enemies who would threaten it."
